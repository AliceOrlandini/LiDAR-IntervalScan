# LiDAR-IntervalScan

LiDAR-IntervalScan is a Swift application that leverages the power of LiDAR and ARKit to perform 3D scans at regular intervals of 30 seconds. 
Each scan result is saved in the .obj format, providing a comprehensive tool for capturing and storing 3D meshes. 
This project is ideal for exploring the potential of periodic 3D scanning in AR environments.

## Getting Started

To use LiDAR-IntervalScan, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
4. Include the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the project root directory.
